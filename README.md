# Telecom-churn-analysis
In this project, the objective is to identify customers who are most likely to cancel their subscription with a fictional telecom company. Addressing customer churn is crucial because it allows for targeted retention strategies to encourage these customers to remain and reduce their departure. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the OpenML public repository and includes information on customer accounts and usage for both churn and non-churn clients. This project involves supervised classification, where machine learning algorithms will be employed to develop predictive models and assess their accuracy and performance. The aim is to determine the most effective model for the business context.
